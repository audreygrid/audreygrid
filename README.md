## 🚀 About Me

I first started programming as a **Roblox Game Developer at 12 years old**.  
Creating experiences that people could enjoy drew me deeply into software development.

Over the years, I’ve learned the value of:
- Solving problems creatively  
- Constantly improving my craft  
- Building projects people actually enjoy using  

Today, I work passionately with **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Lua**, with a strong interest in **Web Development** and **Game Development**.
